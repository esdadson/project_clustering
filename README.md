# KMeans Clustering Project
The KMeans clustering project, although trivial, is one of the first projects
that I conducted in the Python programming language. 

Learning outcomes:
- Understand object-oriented programming in Python.
- Be able to plot using matplotlib.
- Import and use common packages such as NumPy, Pandas, and Sklearn.
